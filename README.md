# VLC Modulation Toolkit

## 1. Overview
This toolkit provides a **user-centric platform** for simulating indoor **Visible Light Communication (VLC)** systems using the open-source **GNU Radio** framework. Users can switch between different modulation schemes (e.g., **OOK, DCO-OFDM, ACO-OFDM**) and configure parameters (like M-QAM order). The toolkit also computes **Bit Error Rate (BER)** to help evaluate performance. It can be readily adapted for **real-time experiments** by replacing file sinks/sources with **USRP** hardware.

This work was **published** in an 2019 IEEE International Conference on Advanced Networks and Telecommunications Systems (ANTS) â€“ details and citation info below.

## 2. High-Level Implementation
- **Transmission Block**  
  1. Convert user input (text, audio, video) into a bitstream.  
  2. Encode and modulate (e.g., OOK, OFDM variants).  
  3. Save to a file (or send via USRP in real-time scenarios).

- **Receiver Block**  
  1. Receive the transmitted signal and optionally add **Gaussian noise**.  
  2. Demodulate and decode using a custom Python block.  
  3. Recover the original information and compute the **BER**.

Both blocks are built using **GNU Radio** flow graphs, with Python-based custom modules for the core signal processing.
